UC Berkeley Buildings Energy Consumption Prediction

## About the Project
**Using Machine Learning Models: Long short term memory**
*Using Machine Learning Models: Long short term memory*
This project has the goal of predicting what the future energy consumption of UC buildings will be based on change in weather conditions and occupancy patterns, and how that can assist in making a retroffting plan and also better resource allocation for when and which buildings need upgrades
